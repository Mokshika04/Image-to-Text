# OCR and Language Translation System

🔥 **Overview**
This project combines **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** with **language translation** to automatically convert text from images into multiple languages. Using advanced machine learning and neural network architectures, it accurately extracts and translates text in real-time, enhancing accessibility and usability across diverse applications.

By integrating OCR technologies and translation APIs, the system bridges language barriers and improves efficiency in processing visual data. It is especially useful in multilingual contexts such as international travel, global business, and digital content management. The system is designed to be scalable and adaptable for future improvements.
